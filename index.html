			<h1 class="size0">Emerging Landscapes</h1>
				<span class="text0">
					This is my landscape. I coded it. When you write code, you have to write it linearly, line-by-line. It felt appropriate to present my work and creative practice this way, too. It’s up to the computer to interpret code and display the encoded data structurally and aesthetically. You can be the computer for today.
				</span>
				<span class="text0">
					To assemble this landscape, I recounted all of the projects I had created since coming to RISD. I discovered that while many projects fit into numerous areas of my landscape, a few areas felt entirely neglected. That was a side effect of switching disciplines, from sound and theater to primarily graphics.
				</span>
				<span class="text0">
					Both those old flames didn’t disappear. I’ve rediscovered computer science as a creative medium, and in doing so have found ways to make my work more performative. And in teaching code and technology to designers, I’ve rediscovered a love for collaboration and community, albeit in new ways.
				</span>
				<span class="text0">
					The landscape that emerges is consequently linear and cyclical. It’s linear because life is linear, and as such my work has followed a clear progression in the past year and change. But it’s cyclical because I keep returning to old ideas with the aurora of new ideas. And a circle is just a line, anyway.
				</span>

			<h2 class="size1">Areas</h2>

				<h3 class="size2">Play & Playfulness</h3>
					<span class="text1">
						Work is not worth doing if it isn’t engaging. To me, engaging work has to be playful in some way. Playful work doesn’t have to be joyful, though, but it’s certainly more fun if it is. I like to create playful things and design playfully.
					</span>
					<span class="size3">Games & Toys</span>
					<span class="size3">Performance & Performativity</span>
					<span class="size3">Humor</span>

				<h3 class="size2">Community</h3>
					<span class="text1">
						I moved to Providence with my partner, now fiancée, Maddie. As theater practitioners, community is a shared value between us. When we moved, we really moved, but thankfully we’ve found a home here.
					</span>
					<span class="size3">Teaching & Pedagogy</span>
					<span class="size3">Civic Engagement & Generosity</span>
					<span class="size3">Collaboration & Open Source Ideology</span>

				<h3 class="size2">Interactive & Computational Media</h3>
					<span class="text1">
						The canon I worshipped as a kid consisted of video games and early-internet content — Adobe Flash games and animations. Then, I studied computer science and didn’t know what to do with it. Now, I’m figuring it out.
					</span>
					<span class="size3">Websites</span>
					<span class="size3">Generative Art</span>
					<span class="size3">Video Games</span>

				<h3 class="size2">Sound</h3>
					<span class="text1">
						I thought I would be a composer. But when I composed, the process became too personal. So I decided I would compose only for myself. It turns out I’m not great at sticking to that promise.
					</span>
					<span class="size3">Music & Songs</span>
					<span class="size3">Sound Design</span>
					<span class="size3">Musical Performance</span>

				<h3 class="size2">Storytelling</h3>
					<span class="text1">
						Working in theater was incredible, because every aesthetic choice had a purpose — to create deeper meaning for the audience. And then I stopped making theater. Did I stop telling stories?
					</span>
					<span class="size3">Theater</span>
					<span class="size3">Writing</span>
